## Description:
This project was quite difficult at the start as there are many moving parts to wrap my head around. Once things clicked, everything fell into place and I was able to add the required functionality to the site. I now have a better idea of MongoDB CRUD works. I wish I could've made the post and update requests async but I could not get them to work despite a few different attempts. This was also a crash course in learning to deploy a MongoDB database through heroku. Thankfully, the included tutorial was quite helpful.

## Installation Instructions:

This requires a number of npm modules. Open the terminal and begin with ```npm init``` followed by ```npm i``` to hopefully automatically install all required dependencies. You will need to deploy your own MongoDB database through Atlas and attach the required env variables to your heroku deployment.

Run the program by opening your terminal in the main folder and typing ```npm start```

## Usage:

For tracking resistance and cardio workouts online with a MongoDB database.
